# halfcab
Yet another JS data binding library using components, but spinning 180Â° and going back to the easy way of doing things instead of trying to ride fakie all the time to show off.

halfcab will use Javascript string templates for its templating language, have server side rendering without any complexities, the ability to keep your favourite routing on the server (Hapi, Koa, Express, etc) and be tiny in file size.
