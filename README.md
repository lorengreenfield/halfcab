# halfcab
Halfcab is a universal JavaScript framework that assembles some elegant and easy to use libraries made by some very clever people, then adds some glue, sets some defaults, and hides a bit of the implementation so you don't have to worry about it.

## What you get
- Syntax is all the web framework, no domain specific language, just APIs - JS, CSS, HTML
- Component style architecture  with es2015 template literals
- Components contain JS, HTML and CSS altogether
- Both client side and server side routing and server side component rendering
- State management, including state history tracking for easy undo-redo
- Built to work with material-components-web (UI components)

### Components
yo-yo

### Inline CSS
csjs-inject

### Routing
sheet-router

### State management
event-emitter + deepmerge

### Network requests
axios

### Utils
next-tick

### UI
material-components-web


##TODO - we don't need to go through all the libraries in use, just go through what you get and how to use it.
